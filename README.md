# fleetie-discord
Fleetie is a discord bot written in python, built for groups in online games to recieve Discord Pings from other servers in their own server. I made this for my EVE Online corporation so we could recieve fleet pings from other groups without having to physically look in each individual server. This is not meant for spying on other groups, but is meant for better coordination between groups who often work together.
