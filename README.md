# fleetie-discord
Fleetie is a discord bot written in python, built for groups in online games to recieve Discord Pings from other servers in their own server. I made this for my EVE Online corporation so we could recieve fleet pings from other groups without all members having to be in each individual server. This is not meant for spying on other groups, but is meant for better coordination between groups who often work together. This sort of use wouldnt even be possible, as it needs to be approved and added by all server owners to function correctly.

### Setup
#### Assuming you have already set up your bot on discord and added it to the appropriate servers...
1. Download the package and unzip.
2. Open bot.py in a text editor
3. Fill in Send and Receive channels with the appropriate channel ID's
4. Open .env in a text editor
5. Place your discord bot's token within the appropriate field.
6. Save & Host. I personally used replit.com in tandem with UptimeRobot (as seen in this tutorial: https://youtu.be/SPTfmiYiuok?t=3529) and left the function for hosting this way in the bot.
